There was once a turkey that walked to the store and bought some grapes. At the store he ran into his friend the water buffalo who was there to buy some cheese. The turkey and the water buffalo had a small chat at the store and the turkey invited the water buffalo to his house. The water buffalo accepted this invitation and the bought there cheese and grapes and rushed to the turkeys house. At his house they started watching some television but they got bored very quickly. sense the turkey was so bored he decided that he decided that they should make something to eat but all they had was the cheese and grapes they just bought at the store. The water buffalo suggested that they mix them together so the turkey got out his blender and threw in the grapes and cheese. Just a few moment grape cheese was born and it was the most delicious thing they had ever tasted.
